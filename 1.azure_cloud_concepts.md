## Cloud Computing

**Cloud computing** is the delivery of computing services over the internet rather than from on-premises infrastructure. These services include compute (virtual machines), storage, databases, networking, and higher-level services such as machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and IoT.
A defining feature is elasticity: resources can be scaled up or down quickly without building new physical infrastructure.

## Traditional Datacenter

A **traditional (on-premises) datacenter** is owned and operated by an organization. The organization is responsible for physical facilities, power, cooling, hardware, networking, software, security, and patching. Capacity planning must be done in advance.

---

## Shared Responsibility Model

The **shared responsibility model** defines how security and operational responsibilities are divided between the cloud provider and the customer.

* **Always the customer’s responsibility**

  * Data and information stored in the cloud
  * User accounts, identities, and access management
  * Devices that connect to the cloud (laptops, phones, servers)

* **Always the cloud provider’s responsibility**

  * Physical datacenters
  * Physical network infrastructure
  * Physical servers (hosts)

* **Responsibility varies by service model**

  * Operating systems
  * Network controls
  * Applications
  * Identity and infrastructure configuration

The more managed the service, the more responsibility shifts to the provider.

## Cloud Service Models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

**IaaS** provides virtualized compute, storage, and networking.
The customer manages operating systems, middleware, applications, and data.
This model offers the most control but also the most responsibility.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

**PaaS** provides a managed platform for building and running applications.
The provider manages the operating system and runtime; the customer manages applications and data.
This model balances flexibility and operational simplicity.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

**SaaS** delivers fully managed applications over the internet.
The provider manages almost everything; the customer primarily manages data and user access.
This model minimizes operational overhead.

## Cloud Deployment Models

### Public Cloud

A **public cloud** is owned and operated by a third-party provider and shared across multiple customers.
Key characteristics include pay-as-you-go pricing, rapid scaling, and no capital expenditure for hardware.

### Private Cloud

A **private cloud** is used by a single organization. It may be hosted on-premises or in a dedicated off-site facility.
It offers greater control and isolation but higher cost and less elasticity than public cloud.

### Hybrid Cloud

A **hybrid cloud** combines private and public cloud environments.
It allows workloads to move between environments, often used for burst capacity, regulatory constraints, or data sensitivity.

### Multi-Cloud

A **multi-cloud** approach uses multiple public cloud providers simultaneously.
This may be done to avoid vendor lock-in, use best-of-breed services, or support migrations between providers.

## Consumption-Based Model

The **consumption-based model** means customers pay only for the cloud resources they actually use.
If a resource is not running or consumed, it is not billed. This enables flexible scaling and cost control.

---

## Capital Expenditure (CapEx)

**CapEx** refers to large, up-front investments in physical assets, such as datacenters, servers, and networking equipment.
Traditional IT infrastructure is largely CapEx-driven.

---

## Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

**OpEx** refers to ongoing expenses for services consumed over time.
Cloud computing shifts IT spending from CapEx to OpEx by charging for usage rather than ownership.

---

## Elasticity

**Elasticity** is the ability to rapidly scale resources up or down in response to demand.
This is a core advantage of cloud computing compared to fixed-capacity datacenters.

---

## Scalability

**Scalability** is the ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources.
Cloud platforms allow both vertical (bigger machines) and horizontal (more machines) scaling.

---

## Pay-As-You-Go Pricing

**Pay-as-you-go pricing** means billing is based on actual usage (compute hours, storage consumed, data transferred).
This enables precise cost alignment with business demand.

---

## Key Takeaway

Cloud computing replaces fixed, up-front infrastructure investment with flexible, on-demand services.
Responsibility for security and operations is shared between provider and customer, with the balance determined by the chosen service and deployment model.
