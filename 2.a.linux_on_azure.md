## 1\. Cloud service models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

A cloud model where **Azure manages physical infrastructure** (datacenters, hardware, networking fabric), while **you manage everything above the OS layer**. In Linux on Azure, this typically means provisioning and operating Linux virtual machines, storage, networking, security configuration, patching, and monitoring yourself.

**Typical Azure IaaS examples:** Azure Virtual Machines, VM Scale Sets.

---

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

A cloud model where **Azure manages the infrastructure and runtime platform**, and you deploy applications without managing servers or operating systems. You trade infrastructure flexibility for faster development, built-in scalability, and reduced operational overhead.

**Typical Azure PaaS examples:** Azure App Service, Azure Functions, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

---

### Database as a Service (DBaaS)

A managed service model where **Azure operates databases for you**, including patching, backups, high availability, and replication. You focus on schema design, queries, and application integration rather than database operations.

**Typical Azure DBaaS examples:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB.

---

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

A fully managed application delivered over the internet that users subscribe to. Azure hosts both Microsoft and third-party SaaS offerings, but SaaS is **not the focus** of Linux infrastructure planning.

**Examples:** Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365\.

---

## 2\. Linux on Azure fundamentals

### Linux distribution (distro)

A packaged Linux operating system combining the kernel, system libraries, package manager, and tooling. On Azure, you can:

* Use **Azure Marketplace images**  
* Bring your own custom image  
* Bring your own subscription for supported vendors

Common enterprise distros include **RHEL**, **SUSE**, and **Ubuntu**.

---

### Azure Marketplace

A catalog of prebuilt virtual machine images, applications, and services published by Microsoft and third parties. Marketplace Linux images are preconfigured to work optimally on Azure (drivers, kernel features, integration tools).

---

### Endorsed Linux distributions

Linux distributions **officially supported and co-engineered with Microsoft**, providing:

* Azure-tuned kernels  
* Faster bug fixes  
* Joint Microsoft–vendor support

These are strongly recommended for production workloads.

---

### Bring Your Own Subscription (BYOS)

A licensing model that allows you to use **existing Red Hat or SUSE subscriptions** on Azure virtual machines, often combined with the Azure Hybrid Benefit to reduce costs.

---

### Azure Hybrid Benefit

A cost-saving program that lets you reuse existing eligible software licenses (notably RHEL and SLES) on Azure, reducing VM costs compared to pay-as-you-go licensing.

---

## 3\. Compute and scaling concepts

### Azure Virtual Machine (VM)

A software-defined computer running in Azure that behaves like a traditional Linux server. You control the OS, installed software, users, and configuration.

---

### Virtual Machine Scale Sets

A service that lets you deploy and manage **groups of identical VMs** from a single configuration. Used for:

* High availability  
* Horizontal scaling  
* Load-balanced workloads  
* Stateless services and containers

---

### Elastic scaling

The ability to **automatically increase or decrease compute resources** based on demand, either manually or through rules.

---

### High availability

Architecting systems so services remain accessible even if individual components fail, commonly achieved through redundancy and load balancing.

---

## 4\. Networking concepts

### Azure Virtual Network (VNet)

A logically isolated private network in Azure, equivalent to an on-premises data center network. VNets allow Azure resources (VMs, services) to communicate securely with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

---

### Network Virtual Appliance (NVA)

A third-party VM that provides networking or security functionality such as:

* Firewalls  
* Load balancers  
* Routers  
* Proxies  
* WAN optimizers

Often used to replicate existing enterprise network architectures in Azure.

---

### Load balancing

Distributing incoming traffic across multiple compute resources to improve availability, reliability, and performance.

---

## 5\. Storage concepts

### Azure Storage

A globally available storage platform offering multiple data models and access patterns, usable by Linux workloads via REST APIs, SDKs, CLI tools, and file protocols.

---

### Azure Managed Disks

Block-level storage volumes managed by Azure and attached to virtual machines. Typical Linux VM disk types:

* OS disk (boot volume)  
* Temporary disk (paging/swap)  
* Data disks

---

### Azure Blob Storage

A massively scalable **object storage** service for unstructured data (text, images, binaries). Includes **Data Lake Storage Gen2** features for big-data analytics.

---

### Azure Files

Fully managed **file shares** accessible via SMB or NFS, suitable for shared storage across cloud and on-premises environments.

---

### Azure NetApp Files

Enterprise-grade file storage delivered as an Azure native service but managed through NetApp. Designed for high-performance, file-based workloads requiring NFS, SMB, or dual-protocol access.

---

### Azure Queue Storage

A reliable message-queue service for asynchronous communication between application components.

---

### Azure Table Storage

A NoSQL key-value store for schemaless structured data.

---

### Azure Elastic SAN

A managed storage-area-network service that simplifies deploying and scaling shared block storage in Azure.

---

## 6\. Application and container platforms

### Azure App Service

A fully managed platform for hosting web apps and APIs. Supports Linux runtimes and automatically manages OS patching, scaling, and availability.

---

### Azure Functions

A serverless compute service where code runs in response to events. Designed for short-lived, event-driven workloads without managing servers.

---

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

A managed Kubernetes platform where Azure operates the control plane and core maintenance tasks. You deploy and manage containerized applications without running Kubernetes infrastructure yourself.

---

### Azure Container Instances (ACI)

A lightweight service for running containers **without managing VMs or clusters**, ideal for isolated or short-running workloads.

---

### Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO)

A fully managed OpenShift platform jointly operated and supported by Microsoft and Red Hat, providing enterprise-grade Kubernetes with integrated support.

---

## 7\. Management and automation tools

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

The **central management layer** for all Azure resources. All Azure deployments, updates, and deletions pass through ARM, enabling:

* Role-based access control  
* Tagging  
* Resource locking  
* Consistent APIs across tools

---

### Azure CLI

A cross-platform command-line tool for managing Azure resources, commonly used from Linux shells and automation scripts.

---

### Azure portal

A web-based graphical interface for managing Azure subscriptions, resources, and deployments.

---

### Terraform
