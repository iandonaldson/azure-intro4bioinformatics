Here’s a **list of all the commands from that Microsoft Learn exercise**, each preceded by a **brief description of what the command does**. These commands come from the “Exercise – Retrieve an existing Docker image and deploy it locally” section of the learning module. ([Microsoft Learn][1])

---

### 🐋 Pull a Docker image from a registry

```bash
# Pull the ASP.NET sample web app image from the Microsoft Container Registry
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

---

### 📦 Show local images

```bash
# List all Docker images stored locally
docker image ls
```

---

### 🚀 Run a container in detached mode

```bash
# Start the pulled image as a container in the background, mapping port 8080 on the host to port 8080 in the container
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

---

### 📄 View running containers

```bash
# List running Docker containers
docker ps
```

---

### 🛑 Stop a specific running container

```bash
# Stop the running container, replacing <NAME> with the actual container name
docker container stop <NAME>
```

---

### 📋 View all containers (including stopped)

```bash
# List all containers, including those that have exited
docker ps -a
```

---

### 🗑️ Remove a stopped container

```bash
# Remove the stopped container from your local Docker host, replacing <NAME> with the container name
docker container rm <NAME>
```

---

### 📦 List images again

```bash
# List all Docker images currently available locally
docker image ls
```

---

### 🗑️ Remove the pulled image

```bash
# Delete the ASP.NET sample image from your local machine
docker image rm mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

---

✅ These commands illustrate the full **local Docker workflow** from pulling an image, running and inspecting it, to stopping and cleaning up both containers and images. ([Microsoft Learn][1])

If you’d like, I can also explain what each command outputs and how to interpret the results.
