# 🐳 Docker Containers on Azure — Glossary for Bioinformatics Teams

This glossary summarizes **all key terms and concepts** from your notes, with added Azure context and bioinformatics-relevant examples (e.g., RNA-Seq, STAR, Nextflow, Snakemake, variant calling pipelines).

---

## A

### **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**

A fully managed Azure service that runs containers without managing VMs or Kubernetes.

**Bioinformatics example:**
Run a short-lived STAR alignment job for a small FASTQ dataset without provisioning a full VM cluster.

---

### **Azure Container Apps**

A managed container platform built on Kubernetes but abstracted from the user.

**Bioinformatics example:**
Deploy a web-based QC dashboard (FastQC/MultiQC results) as a scalable containerized service.

---

### **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**

Azure’s private container image registry for storing and managing Docker images.

**Bioinformatics example:**
Store your lab’s custom image:

```
myacr.azurecr.io/rnaseq-pipeline:1.2.0
```

Containing STAR, samtools, R, and your analysis scripts.

---

### **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**

Managed Kubernetes cluster service for orchestrating many containers.

**Bioinformatics example:**
Run large RNA-Seq or WGS pipelines across hundreds of samples using containerized tools (STAR, GATK, Cell Ranger).

---

## B

### **Base Image**

An image built from `scratch` (empty image) or minimal OS.

**Bioinformatics example:**
Building a minimal container with only:

* STAR binary
* Required libraries
* No full Linux distro

This reduces image size and attack surface.

---

### **Bind Mount**

Maps a specific host directory into a container.

**Pros:** High performance
**Cons:** Tied to host filesystem layout

**Bioinformatics example:**
Mount `/mnt/fastq` from an Azure VM into the container:

```
-v /mnt/fastq:/data
```

---

### **Bridge Network (Linux Default)**

Private internal Docker network. Containers communicate via IP.

Ports must be explicitly published.

**Example:**

```
--publish 8080:80
```

**Bioinformatics example:**
Expose a Jupyter notebook running in a container.

---

## C

### **Container**

A running instance of a container image.

Think:

> Image = blueprint
> Container = running process

**Bioinformatics example:**
Each RNA-Seq sample processed in its own container instance.

---

### **Container Image**

Immutable packaged software unit containing:

* OS (optional)
* Application binaries
* Dependencies
* Configuration

**Bioinformatics example:**
An image containing:

* Ubuntu
* STAR
* samtools
* Python
* R
* Your pipeline script

---

### **Container Lifecycle**

States:

* Created
* Running
* Paused
* Stopped
* Killed
* Removed

Important because:
Containers are **ephemeral**.

---

### **Container OS**

The OS inside the image (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04).

Linux containers share host kernel.

---

### **Container Port Mapping**

Maps container port to host port:

```
--publish 8080:80
```

---

### **Continuous Integration (CI)**

Using containers to ensure builds are reproducible across environments.

**Bioinformatics example:**
Every Git commit builds a container with pinned tool versions.

---

## D

### **Docker**

Containerization platform used to build and run containers.

---

### **Docker Client**

CLI (`docker`) or Docker Desktop.

Sends REST calls to daemon.

---

### **Docker Daemon (dockerd)**

Background server process managing containers and images.

---

### **Docker Engine**

Client + daemon + REST API.

---

### **Dockerfile**

Text file defining how to build an image.

**Example (bioinformatics):**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt update && apt install -y star samtools
WORKDIR /data
ENTRYPOINT ["STAR"]
```

---

### **Docker Hub**

Public container registry.

For research:
You might pull:

```
biocontainers/star:v2.7.10a
```

---

### **Docker Image Tag**

Version label:

```
rnaseq:1.0.0
rnaseq:latest
```

**Best practice in research:**
Never rely on `latest`. Pin versions for reproducibility.

---

### **Docker Network**

Defines how containers communicate.

Linux options:

* bridge
* host
* overlay
* macvlan
* ipvlan
* none

Windows options:

* NAT
* Transparent
* Overlay
* L2Bridge
* L2Tunnel
* None

---

### **docker build**

Builds an image from Dockerfile.

---

### **docker run**

Creates and starts a container.

---

### **docker ps**

Lists containers.

---

### **docker images**

Lists local images.

---

### **docker rm**

Removes container.

---

### **docker rmi**

Removes image.

---

## E

### **ENTRYPOINT**

Defines the command that runs when container starts.

In bioinformatics:

```
ENTRYPOINT ["snakemake"]
```

---

### **EXPOSE**

Documents intended container port.

Does not automatically publish.

---

## H

### **Host Network**

Container shares host’s network stack.

Not available on Windows.

---

### **Host OS**

Operating system running Docker.

Linux containers require Linux host (or VM).

---

### **Hyper-V Isolation (Windows)**

Extra VM-level isolation for Windows containers.

Adds security layer.

---

## I

### **Image ID**

Unique SHA-based identifier for image.

More reliable than name.

---

### **Immutability**

Images cannot be modified once built.

Ensures:
Reproducibility in bioinformatics pipelines.

---

## K

### **Kernel Sharing**

Linux containers share host kernel.

This is why containers are lightweight compared to VMs.

---

## N

### **NAT Network (Windows Default)**

Equivalent to Linux bridge.

---

### **None Network**

Disables networking.

Useful for:

* Security testing
* Offline pipeline validation

---

## O

### **Overlay Network**

Allows containers across multiple hosts to communicate.

Important in:

* Kubernetes
* AKS

---

### **Operating System Virtualization**

Containers virtualize at OS level (not hypervisor level).

---

## P

### **Parent Image**

Image built from another image.

Example:

```
FROM ubuntu:22.04
```

---

### **Port Publishing**

Maps container ports to host.

---

### **Process Isolation**

Each container runs isolated processes.

---

## S

### **Scratch Image**

Empty base image.

Used for ultra-minimal containers.

---

### **Service Monitoring**

`docker stats` shows:

* CPU
* Memory
* Network
* Disk I/O

But not persistent.

In Azure:
Use Azure Monitor or Log Analytics.

---

### **SMB Mount (Windows)**

Mount remote shared storage into container.

---

### **Stackable Unification File System (UnionFS)**

Layered filesystem model.

Each Dockerfile step adds a layer.

Benefits:

* Caching
* Efficient storage

---

### **Storage Driver**

Mechanism allowing container write layer.

Adds abstraction overhead.

---

## V

### **Virtual Machine (VM)**

Full OS virtualization via hypervisor.

Heavier than containers.

---

### **Volume**

Docker-managed persistent storage.

Preferred over bind mounts.

**Bioinformatics example:**
Mount Azure Blob storage via plugin for large BAM files.

---

## W

### **Writable Layer**

Temporary top layer added when container runs.

Destroyed when container removed.

---

# 🔬 Bioinformatics-Specific Considerations

## Reproducibility

Containers:

* Pin tool versions
* Freeze OS environment
* Avoid “works on my machine” issues

Critical for:

* Regulatory submissions
* Multi-site collaborations
* Manuscript reproducibility

---

## Large Data Workloads

Containers are stateless — data must be externalized.

Best practice on Azure:

* Store FASTQ/BAM in Azure Blob
* Mount via volume
* Use ephemeral SSD for scratch

---

## Scaling RNA-Seq on Azure

Small job:
→ Azure Container Instance

Medium pipeline:
→ Azure Container Apps

Large multi-sample pipeline:
→ AKS + Nextflow/Snakemake

---

## When NOT Ideal in Bioinformatics

* Heavy I/O without proper storage strategy
* Need for kernel customization
* Highly stateful HPC workloads without orchestration

---

| Feature           | Containers    | VMs      |
| ----------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Startup time      | Seconds       | Minutes  |
| Resource overhead | Low           | High     |
| Kernel            | Shared        | Separate |
| Isolation         | Process-level | Full OS  |
| Reproducibility   | Excellent     | Good     |
